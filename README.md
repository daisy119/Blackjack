# üÉè Blackjack 

![Alt text](images/Gamepic-wide.png)
 
 Blackjack is a card game in which the objective is to achieve a hand value of 21 or les while susrpassing the dealer's hand. PLayers begin by choosing bets range from $2 to $5 and then clicking the "Deal" button. Throughout the game, players can decide to click "hit" or "stand" button based on the strength of their current hand. Exceeding a hand value of 21 results in a loss for the players. Players can click "Play New Game " to resetart the game. 

 I choose this game because ti is a low-entry barrier game.
